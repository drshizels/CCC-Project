PROJECT INFO:
- Location: ~/Desktop/trae/the-CC-project/
- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/drshizels/CCC-Project
- Live Site: https://drshizels.github.io/CCC-Project/

WHAT WE DID THIS SESSION:
-------------------------
1. Videos weren't loading on GitHub Pages because they exceeded GitHub's 100MB file limit

2. Switched from self-hosted videos to YouTube embeds

3. Created "BRANDS" section with 5 YouTube Shorts:
   - ijD_MkEbvKU
   - wmgaVDNeV7g
   - kVJXxwRpOXQ
   - CXvF5_tbWZ8
   - OAraIlpncto

4. Removed HAT and EVENTS sections - only BRANDS remains

5. Added deep shadows to the video embeds for depth

6. Tried a custom thumbnail overlay to hide YouTube's red play button but it didn't work, so reverted to regular YouTube embeds

CURRENT STATE:
--------------
- Site has one video section: "BRANDS" with 5 YouTube Shorts
- Videos display with shadows and scale up on hover
- Regular YouTube embeds (with red play button)
- 3D "CCC" text in hero section with Vanta.js topology background
- Floating wireframe CCCs throughout the page

FILES:
------
- index.html - Main HTML structure
- styles.css - All styling including video carousel
- script.js - Three.js 3D text, Vanta background, scroll animations

TO TEST LOCALLY:
----------------
Run: python3 -m http.server 8080
Then open: http://localhost:8080

(YouTube embeds don't work from file:// URLs, need localhost)

NOTES:
------
- Large video files (*.mp4) are in .gitignore to avoid GitHub size limits
- User is a videographer in Glendale, CA building portfolio site
